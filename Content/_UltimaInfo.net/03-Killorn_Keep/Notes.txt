
Killorn Keep
Here are the maps of Killorn Keep, airborne stronghold of the Guardian's forces.

Killorn Keep, Level 1
The NE stairway leads to the main cellars and a trap.
The SE stairway is behind secret doors.
The Trilkhai are worth talking to.
Relk's rooms are the ones just south of the stables.

Killorn Keep, Level 2
The central area has no entrances. It takes spells to reach it.
To safely enter the trap room either jump or remove one of the candles.
Don't kill the brain creatures unless you want Killorn Keep to fall out of the sky.
It is there that you need to use the Scepter.
