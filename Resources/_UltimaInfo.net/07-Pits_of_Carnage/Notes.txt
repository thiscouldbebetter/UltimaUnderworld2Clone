
The Pits of Carnage
Here are the maps of the Pits of Carnage, savage prison of the criminals of the Guardian's domain.

Pits of Carnage, Level 1
Dorstag has the Gem. You need to kill many opponents to be worth to challenge him. Alternately killing Zoria will result in him being impressed enough to accept a challenge. However insulting him allows you to choose the arena when he reacts by challenging you. Blog (level 3) will also force him to give up the gem if you befriend him.
The Gate is sealed by the Guardian's magic: use the Scepter there.

Pits of Carnage, Level 2
The bridge across the cavern leads all the way across.
Zoranthus is worth speaking to.
There is no blackrock gem where one is marked. Be careful of using the particular rune combination actually found there.

Pits of Carnage, Level 3
Befriending Blog is one way to get the Gem from Dorstag. You can let him win, or impress him with the word 'Grey' and make a draw.
The Dire Reaper's branches can act as a lightning wand.
