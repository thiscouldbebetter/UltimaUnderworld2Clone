
The Ice Caverns
Here are the maps of the Ice Caverns, tomb of the Lost City of Anodunos.

Ice Caverns, Level 1
There is a scroll giving the settings of the dam defenses. The first settings allow access to the key to the controls. The second allows access to the controls themselves. Alternately magic can open locks or allow passage through walls.

Ice Caverns, Level 2
The city area can only be entered by opening the dam to melt the ice.
Beatrice can tell the story of the city, and Mokpo can also give clues valuable later on.
Beatrice waits where you should use the Scepter.
There is an item which can give a valuable insight to both the immediate and longer term futures in the old magic shop.
The small cavern in the far NW contains magic scrolls. Use spells to enter.
