The files in this directory and its subdirectories are adapted
from the game _Ultima Underworld 2_, originally published
by Origin Systems.  The files were obtained from a website
hosted at the URL

	https://ultimainfo.nullneuron.net/Maps/UW2Maps.htm.

The text files here are adapted from that site as well.
A note on that site reads:

	These maps are screenshots from the in-game automap system.
	Note that they are not from my own game. I found these graphics
	on an RPG compilation CD-ROM. No author was mentioned.
